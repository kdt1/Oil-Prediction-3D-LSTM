# Oil-Prediction-3D-LSTM

In this study, we will attempt to extract characteristics from a variety of dominating elements that are strongly associated with WTI Crude Oil Price: oil supply and weather data . Meanwhile, historical prices, such as opening and closing prices, volume, and technical indicators, will also be analyzed. The performance of several models will be evaluated using multidimensional data. Following that, we want to examine and compare the prediction's accuracy and outcome to real data. By evaluating which machine learning model is the most effective at forecasting crude oil prices, we want to study which features have more influence on the prediction of oil prices.

We attempted to enter the data as a three-dimensional dataset. It does, however, provide a consistent outcome of the projected result. We think this is because oil supply data is collected on a weekly basis. To train the model, we backfilled the empty date with weekly data. This data property has a considerable effect on output prediction.
